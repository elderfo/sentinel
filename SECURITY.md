## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to **sentinel-security@elderfo.com**.

Include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for non-critical

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. Reporter submits vulnerability privately
2. We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the fix and publish a security advisory
5. Reporter is credited (unless they prefer anonymity)

We ask that you give us reasonable time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the Sentinel project repository and any official deployments. Third-party integrations and forks are outside the scope of this policy.

Thank you for helping keep Sentinel and its users safe.
